This project is based upon the data provided from the Automatic Weather Station(AWS) located in Mera Naulek region in Nepal.

## Meteorological Variables Used:
Relative Humidity in %.<br>
Air Temperature in Degree Celsius.<br>
Wind Speed in m/s.<br>
Shortwave net radiation in w/m2<br>
Longwave net radiation in w/m2<br>
Initial Snow Depth in cm.<br>
<br>
After running the script, above 6 variables are required to make prediction for snow depth after 30 minute time.
